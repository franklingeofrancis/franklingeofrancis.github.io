Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. Considered by many as the finest batsman to wield a cricket bat in more than half a century. He could be both aesthetically pleasing and yet brutally assaulting at the same time. The minimalist effort through which he caressed the ball past the non striker could alleviate all your pains and yet haunt scores of bowlers in their worst nightmares.

In a career which spanned for more than two decades, he amassed runs at a staggering pace and along the way he wrote his name on almost every batting record worth mentioning. One of them being the distinction of the highest run getter in both the Test as well as the ODI version of the game.

So, the question that has been bothering cricket pundits for a while now is, who will beat Sachin? Will it be a mountain too tall to scale like Bradmans test average? Who among the new crop of players are close enough? 

Check out the below visualization, where I pit Sachin against a host of other players, to understand scoring rates. For good measure I've included players from the past as well. Explore & enjoy! Let me know in the comments if you think any potential players are missing in the list.
