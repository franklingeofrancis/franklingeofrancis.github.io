title: So, who will beat Sachin?

[Innocuous press conference in India]  
*Reporter*: Sachin, Ricky Clarke (fictional Australian) has broken your record!!  
*Sachin*: Oh that's great!....eh....but which one??

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. Widely considered as the best batsman on planet earth (mostly by Indians only though, but since we make up 1/6th of the world's population, any opinion of ours is the popular opinion..no?). Nevertheless, he would rank easily in the Top 3 of anybody's list of the best batsmen.

In a career which spanned for more than two decades, he amassed runs at a staggering pace and along the way he wrote his name on almost every batting record worth mentioning. One of them is the distinction of being the highest run getter in both the Test as well as the ODI version of the game.

So, the question is, who will beat Sachin? Check out the below visualization. You might find your answer!
